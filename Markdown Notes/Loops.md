	/*  1. Initalise 'itr' to be zero
		2. Evaluate Condition 
			true: enter loop body
			{loop body code}
			1. At the end of the loop body, execute iteration expression
			Loop to 2L
		False: exit loop */
}

do {
	//always run this at least once
	//at the end of the loop, if condition is true, loop
} while (// condition)

while (// condition)
{
	//at start of the loop body, if "condition" is true, enter body
